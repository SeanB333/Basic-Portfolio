            <p>My name is Sean Brennan and I am currently attending the Houston coding bootcamp. My goal is to complete this
                course as an above average coder. i have had a passion for working with computers sincce a very young age.
                I aim to use my knowledge of development coupled with design elements that I have learned in my current field
                to work on a wide array of projects either stationed or remotely (really shooting for the remotely part).
                I also intend on merging web and mobile applications into the construction fields as I have spent the better
                part of the last 14 years as an HVAC mech. operations manager for an international construction company that
                could greatly benefit from better task management.</p>
